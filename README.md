# Equity Analysis Suite
## Description:
This repository houses the source code for the equity-analysis suite of applications (EAS). The purpose of the EAS is to

The EAS is _**NOT**_ designed to give purchases recommendations and is merely a means to perform various types of stock 
analysis in a more rapid manner. No data returned should be taken as financial advice, please consult with a certified 
professional if you are seeking assitance with how to manage your capital.
